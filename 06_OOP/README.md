## Homework

Create a sketch with a class that defines a car. This car doesn't need to look like a car, it just needs to behave like one. It can even be represented by a simple rectangle. It probably needs methods to:

- Drive
- Reverse
- Brake

And properties like:

- Color
- Top Speed
- Size

Instantiate your car object in the sketch and give it keyboard driving controls.
