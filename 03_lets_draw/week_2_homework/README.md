# Three XCode Open Frameworks Examples

### Project 1, Advanced 3D Example:

I really liked this project since it let me see how 3D works in Open Frameworks. I really like to see how different coding languages incorporate 3D into their coding and this project really let me see how Open Frameworks does 3D. I also Liked how the example showed different camera perspectives.

### Project 2,GUI Example:
I really like how this project is laid out. Since I am a big fan of interactive programs, this one really appealed to me. I loved all of the options that it gave me to use and the interface was very appealing to me. I liked how you could change the position of the shapes and the color of the shape in a RGB scale.

### Project 3, ASCII video:
I really like this project because it uses symbols from the keyboard to creat the image that it sees through the computer's camera. At first, I was wondering why my camera was on when the program was running, but I then realised that when I moved, the image also moved. I think that it is pretty cool that this example can take the image that it recieves from the camera and transform it into a video animation with typing symbols.
