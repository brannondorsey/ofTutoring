#Three Interesting openFrameworks Projects### [Sadly By Your Side](http://www.creativeapplications.net/iphone/sadly-by-your-side-a-music-album-and-a-processingremixing-tool-by-angelo-semeraro/)
I think that this project is interesting because it combines not only the music in the album, but the openFrameworks code for the iPhone. Also I love the idea that it combines the camera of your iOS device, which turns into blue, red, and gray images, and the sounds and tunes that it has in the app. I thought that this was a cool idea for an app, and it makes me want to code in openFrameworks for iOS even more.### [Teary Filter](http://www.creativeapplications.net/vid/teary-filter-by-shohei-fujimoto/) 
I really like how the filter works and creates a ripple-like effect on the desktop, which the app uses as its background. I like how the lines that the user made when he clicked on the screen made water-like animation and made the desktop seem like it was moving, when in fact it wasnâ€™t. The animation and the action of the lines following the front one was really cool-looking to me. ### [RetroScreen](http://www.creativeapplications.net/iphone/retroscreen-iphone-ipad/)
I like the idea of this app, since it has a retro look to it, which I like a lot. I also think that the idea of using not only the touch interface, but also 3D space on an iOS device is really amazing and I think that it can unleash creativity from many people who use the app
